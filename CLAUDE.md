# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-assisted crypto futures trading bot that supports both Coinbase (CEX) and Bluefin (DEX on Sui) exchanges. It uses LangChain-powered decision making with custom VuManChu Cipher indicators. The bot is built with Python 3.12+ using Poetry for dependency management.

## Development Commands

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Install pre-commit hooks
poetry run pre-commit install

# Activate virtual environment
poetry shell
```

### Running the Bot
```bash
# Paper trading mode (safe - no real money)
python -m bot.main live
poetry run ai-trading-bot live

# Paper trading with real market data (default behavior)
# Uses live prices but doesn't place real trades - logs what would happen
python -m bot.main live

# Configure with environment file
cp .env.example .env
python -m bot.main live

# Live trading with real money (dangerous)
# Set SYSTEM__DRY_RUN=false in .env first!
python -m bot.main live

# Backtesting
poetry run ai-trading-bot backtest --from 2024-01-01 --to 2024-12-31
poetry run ai-trading-bot backtest --symbol ETH-USD
```

### Code Quality Tools
```bash
# Format code
poetry run black .

# Lint and fix code issues
poetry run ruff check . --fix

# Format code with Ruff (alternative to black)
poetry run ruff format .

# Type checking
poetry run mypy bot/

# Dead code detection
poetry run vulture bot/

# Security vulnerability scanning
poetry run bandit -r bot/

# HTML/template linting and formatting
poetry run djlint --check --reformat .

# Run all pre-commit hooks
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files

# Full code quality check (recommended)
poetry run ruff check . --fix && poetry run ruff format . && poetry run mypy bot/ && poetry run vulture bot/ && poetry run bandit -r bot/

# Automated code quality script
./scripts/code-quality.sh
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=bot

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_indicators.py
```

### Docker Operations (Simplified for macOS)
```bash
# Quick start (recommended)
docker-compose up

# Run in background
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f ai-trading-bot

# Stop and restart

### Data Flow
Market Data ‚Üí Indicators ‚Üí LLM Agent (with Memory) ‚Üí Validator ‚Üí Risk Manager ‚Üí Exchange ‚Üí Experience Tracking ‚Üí Learning

### Configuration System
- Environment variables in `.env` file
- JSON config files in `config/` directory (development.json, production.json, conservative_config.json)
- Pydantic models for type-safe settings in `bot/config.py`

### Key Technologies
- **Poetry** for dependency management
- **LangChain** + OpenAI for AI decision making
- **coinbase-advanced-py** for exchange integration
- **pandas/numpy** for technical analysis
- **pydantic** v2 for data validation
- **click** for CLI interface
- **rich** for terminal UI

## Development Guidelines

### Technical Indicators
- Implement using vectorized numpy/pandas operations (no for-loops)
- Return both latest state and full series for backtesting
- Follow the VuManChu Cipher reference in `docs/vumanchu_cipher_reference.md`

### LLM Integration
- Prompts located in `prompts/` directory
- JSON schema validation is critical - invalid responses default to HOLD
- Use `TradeAction` pydantic model for structured output

### Safety Measures
- Always test in paper trading mode first (SYSTEM__DRY_RUN=true)
- Validate all trade actions through risk management layer
- Environment variables for API keys - never commit secrets
- Default to conservative settings in development

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for indicators, validator, risk management
- Integration tests for strategy flow
- Backtest coverage on multiple time periods and symbols
- Use pytest fixtures for consistent test data

### Memory and Learning System (MCP)
When MCP is enabled, the bot:
- Stores every trading decision with full market context
- Tracks trade outcomes from entry to exit
- Analyzes patterns in successful/failed trades
- Retrieves similar past experiences before making decisions
- Generates insights and strategy adjustments based on performance
- Maintains a persistent memory across bot restarts

To enable memory features:
1. Set `MCP_ENABLED=true` in your `.env` file
2. Run `docker-compose up mcp-memory` to start the memory server
3. The bot will automatically use the memory-enhanced agent

The memory system includes:
- **TradingExperience**: Complete record of a trade with context and outcome
- **MemoryQuery**: Similarity-based retrieval of relevant past trades
- **PatternPerformance**: Statistical tracking of pattern success rates
- **StrategyAdjustment**: Recommended parameter changes based on analysis
- **LearningInsight**: Discovered correlations and market behaviors

## Environment Setup

Required environment variables:

### Exchange Selection
- `EXCHANGE__EXCHANGE_TYPE` - Exchange to use: "coinbase" or "bluefin" (default: "coinbase")

### Coinbase Configuration
- `EXCHANGE__CDP_API_KEY_NAME` - Coinbase CDP API key name
- `EXCHANGE__CDP_PRIVATE_KEY` - Coinbase CDP private key (PEM format)  

### Bluefin Configuration
- `EXCHANGE__BLUEFIN_PRIVATE_KEY` - Sui wallet private key (hex format)
- `EXCHANGE__BLUEFIN_NETWORK` - Network: "mainnet" or "testnet" (default: "mainnet")

### Trading Configuration
- `LLM__OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key
- `SYSTEM__DRY_RUN` - Set to "false" for live trading, "true" for paper trading (default: "true")
- `TRADING__SYMBOL` - Trading pair (default: "BTC-USD")
- `TRADING__LEVERAGE` - Futures leverage (default: 5)

### Real Market Data
The bot exclusively uses real market data from exchanges - no mock data is generated:

All trading modes use live market data:

The trading system will:
- ‚úÖ Use real-time market prices from your configured exchange for all operations
- ‚úÖ Fetch historical data from live exchange APIs  
- ‚úÖ Process real WebSocket feeds for live price updates
- ‚úÖ Calculate accurate fees, slippage, and margin requirements
- ‚úÖ Provide realistic backtesting and paper trading simulation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Paper trading** (SYSTEM__DRY_RUN=true): Uses real prices, simulates trades
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Live trading** (SYSTEM__DRY_RUN=false): Uses real prices, places real trades

Example paper trading log output:
```
üéØ PAPER TRADING DECISION: LONG | Symbol: SUI-PERP | Current Price: $3.45 | Size: 25%
üìä TRADE SIMULATION DETAILS:
  ‚Ä¢ Current Real Price: $3.45
  ‚Ä¢ Position Size: 724.64 SUI
  ‚Ä¢ Position Value: $2,500.00
  ‚Ä¢ Required Margin: $500.00
‚úÖ PAPER TRADING EXECUTION COMPLETE:
  üéØ Action: LONG
  üíµ Price: $3.4517
  üî¥ Stop Loss: $3.28 (-$123.45)
  üü¢ Take Profit: $3.62 (+$123.45)
```

Optional MCP/Learning environment variables:
- `MCP_ENABLED` - Enable memory and learning features (default: "false")
- `MCP_SERVER_URL` - MCP memory server URL (default: "http://localhost:8765")
- `MEM0_API_KEY` - API key for Mem0 if using cloud storage
- `MCP_MEMORY_RETENTION_DAYS` - Days to retain memories (default: 90)

## Security Notes

- API keys are managed through environment variables
- Container runs as non-root user for security
- Paper trading mode (SYSTEM__DRY_RUN=true) is the default to prevent accidental live trading
- All trading actions go through risk management validation

## Python Code Quality Guidelines

### Linting and Security Tools
- **Ruff**: Fast modern linter for style and quality issues
- **Black**: Code formatting for consistent style
- **isort**: Import sorting and organization
- **MyPy**: Static type checking
- **Bandit**: Security vulnerability scanner that detects:
  - Hardcoded passwords and secrets
  - SQL injection vulnerabilities
  - Shell injection risks
  - Insecure cryptographic practices
  - Use of dangerous functions
- **Vulture**: Dead code detection for:
  - Unused functions, classes, and variables
  - Unreachable code blocks
  - Unused imports

### Security Best Practices
- Run `bandit -r bot/ -ll` for low-confidence security scanning
- Generate security reports: `bandit -r bot/ -f json -o security-report.json`
- Never commit API keys, passwords, or sensitive data to version control
- Use environment variables for all secrets and configuration
- Validate all external inputs and API responses
- Follow principle of least privilege for file permissions and access
