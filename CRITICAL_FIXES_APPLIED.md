# Critical Fixes Applied: UTC Timezone Consistency

## Summary
Fixed datetime timezone mixing issues throughout the codebase to ensure all datetime objects use UTC consistently.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed datetime.now() calls to use UTC
- `/bot/utils/price_conversion.py`: Updated 7 instances of `datetime.now()` to `datetime.now(UTC)`
- `/bot/types/services.py`: Updated 1 instance
- `/bot/types/services_integration.py`: Updated 2 instances
- `/bot/strategy/spread_calculator.py`: Updated 3 instances
- `/bot/utils/graceful_shutdown.py`: Updated 1 instance from deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` to `datetime.now(UTC)`

### 2. Fixed Missing TypeVar in Validation Decorators
- `/bot/validation/decorators.py`: Added missing TypeVar `F` definition

### 3. Added Comprehensive Property Tests
- Created `/tests/property/test_datetime_consistency.py` with property-based tests for:
  - Timezone awareness validation
  - Datetime comparison safety
  - Timestamp ordering consistency
  - Circuit breaker timestamp validation
  - Market data staleness calculations

## Impact
- Prevents timezone-related bugs when comparing datetime objects
- Ensures consistent UTC usage across all modules
- Eliminates deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` usage
- Provides comprehensive test coverage for datetime handling

## Verification
- All datetime creation now uses `datetime.now(UTC)`
- Property tests verify timezone consistency
- No more naive datetime objects in the codebase
- All timestamp comparisons are timezone-safe
