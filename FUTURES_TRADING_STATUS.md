# Futures Trading Status

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Futures Order Routing**: 
   - ETH-USD with `leverage` parameter correctly routes to futures
   - Orders are being placed successfully (confirmed with test order)

2. **Bot Configuration**:
   - Live trading enabled (`SYSTEM__DRY_RUN=false`)
   - Futures enabled (`TRADING__ENABLE_FUTURES=true`)
   - 5-minute intervals configured
   - Bot is detecting when to place futures orders

3. **Automatic Fund Management**:
   - Bot detects when CFM balance is insufficient
   - Automatically schedules sweeps from CBI to CFM
   - Sweep of $256.63 is pending

## ⏳ Current Issue

The sweep from CBI to CFM is taking longer than expected (30+ minutes). This is preventing the bot from executing futures trades.

## 🚀 Once Sweep Completes

The bot will automatically:
1. Detect the CFM balance
2. Place futures orders with leverage
3. Manage positions using nano contracts (0.1 ETH)

## 📊 Test Results

Successfully placed a futures order:
- Order ID: 233ebd25-c1df-4f83-b24f-5707326acb73
- Product: ETH-USD
- Leverage: 5x
- This confirms the API integration is working correctly

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. Wait for the sweep to complete (check with `poetry run python check_sweep_status.py`)
2. Once CFM balance > 0, the bot will start trading futures automatically
3. Monitor positions with `poetry run python scripts/list_futures_positions.py`

## 📝 Important Notes

- Coinbase uses the same symbols (ETH-USD) for both spot and futures
- The `leverage` parameter determines routing (spot vs futures)
- Nano contracts = 0.1 ETH per contract
- Sweeps can take 10-30 minutes (sometimes longer)
