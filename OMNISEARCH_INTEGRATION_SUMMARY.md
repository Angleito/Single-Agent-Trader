# OmniSearch MCP Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully extended the existing `bot/strategy/llm_agent.py` file to integrate OmniSearch MCP functionality for enhanced market intelligence and sentiment analysis. The integration is seamless, maintains backward compatibility, and follows existing code patterns.

## Implementation Details

### 1. LLM Agent Extensions (`bot/strategy/llm_agent.py`)

#### New Constructor Parameter
- Added `omnisearch_client: Optional[OmniSearchClient] = None` parameter
- Automatic detection of OmniSearch availability based on client presence and configuration
- Proper logging of OmniSearch status during initialization

#### New Method: `_get_financial_context()`
```python
async def _get_financial_context(self, market_state: MarketState) -> str
```

**Features:**
- **Crypto Sentiment Analysis**: Gets sentiment for current trading symbol (e.g., BTC, ETH)
- **NASDAQ Market Sentiment**: Provides traditional market context for macro analysis
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzes correlation between crypto and traditional markets (QQQ)
- **Financial News**: Retrieves recent 24h news with sentiment and impact levels
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when API is unavailable
- **Configuration Respect**: Only calls enabled features based on settings

#### Enhanced `_prepare_llm_input()` Method
- Made method `async` to support web search calls
- Added financial context section to prompt data
- Integrated seamlessly with existing market data preparation

#### Updated Prompt Template
- Added new section: "Financial Market Intelligence (Web Search Results)"
- Included guidance on how to use external intelligence
- Enhanced decision-making instructions with web context integration

#### Status and Logging Enhancements
- Added OmniSearch status to `get_status()` method
- Enhanced fallback decision rationale to indicate OmniSearch status
- Comprehensive error handling with appropriate logging levels

### 2. Main Trading Engine Integration (`bot/main.py`)

#### OmniSearch Client Initialization
- Added import for `OmniSearchClient`
- Client creation with proper configuration from settings
- Error handling with graceful fallback if initialization fails

#### Connection Management
- **Startup**: OmniSearch connection in `_initialize_components()`
- **Shutdown**: OmniSearch disconnection in `_shutdown()` cleanup
- Status display in startup summary table

#### Agent Instantiation Updates
- Updated all LLM agent creations to pass `omnisearch_client` parameter:
  - Standard `LLMAgent` instantiation
  - Memory-enhanced agent fallback
  - Memory-enhanced agent with MCP

### 3. Memory Enhanced Agent Updates (`bot/strategy/memory_enhanced_agent.py`)

#### Constructor Enhancement
- Added `omnisearch_client` parameter to constructor
- Proper forwarding to base `LLMAgent` class
- Maintains full backward compatibility

### 4. Configuration Integration

The implementation leverages existing `OmniSearchSettings` in `bot/config.py`:

```python
class OmniSearchSettings(BaseModel):
    enabled: bool = False
    api_key: SecretStr | None = None
    server_url: str = "http://localhost:8766"
    max_results: int = 5
    cache_ttl_seconds: int = 300
    rate_limit_requests_per_minute: int = 10
    timeout_seconds: int = 30
    enable_crypto_sentiment: bool = True
    enable_nasdaq_sentiment: bool = True
    enable_correlation_analysis: bool = True
```

## Key Features

### 1. **Seamless Integration**
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- OmniSearch is completely optional and can be disabled
- Graceful fallback when service is unavailable

### 2. **Comprehensive Market Intelligence**
```text
=== BTC Sentiment Analysis ===
Overall Sentiment: BULLISH (+0.65)
Confidence: 78%
Sources: 24
News Sentiment: +0.72
Social Sentiment: +0.58
Key Drivers: ETF approvals, institutional adoption
Risk Factors: Regulatory uncertainty, market volatility

=== NASDAQ Market Sentiment ===
Overall Sentiment: NEUTRAL (+0.12)
Confidence: 65%
Key Market Drivers: Fed policy, earnings season

=== BTC-NASDAQ Correlation ===
Correlation: POSITIVE MODERATE (+0.42)
Timeframe: 30d
‚ö†Ô∏è Strong positive correlation - crypto may follow stock market moves

=== Recent BTC News (24h) ===
üü¢ Bitcoin ETF sees record inflows as price surges... [HIGH IMPACT]
‚ö™ Cryptocurrency market shows mixed signals amid... [MEDIUM IMPACT]
üî¥ Regulatory concerns weigh on digital assets... [LOW IMPACT]
```

### 3. **Error Handling and Reliability**
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks for each search operation
- Graceful degradation when API endpoints fail
- Caching to reduce API calls and improve performance
- Rate limiting to prevent API throttling

### 4. **Performance Optimizations**
- Async/await pattern for non-blocking operations
- Intelligent caching with configurable TTL
- Parallel search operations where possible
- Connection pooling through aiohttp

### 5. **Enhanced Decision Making**
The LLM now receives rich context including:
- Real-time sentiment analysis
- Market correlation data
- Recent news impact assessment
- Traditional market context
- Risk factor identification

## Usage Examples

### Enable OmniSearch in Configuration
```bash
# Environment variables
OMNISEARCH__ENABLED=true
OMNISEARCH__API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OMNISEARCH__SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8766

# Or in config file
{
  "omnisearch": {
    "enabled": true,
    "api_key": "your_api_key",
    "server_url": "http://localhost:8766",
    "enable_crypto_sentiment": true,
    "enable_nasdaq_sentiment": true,
    "enable_correlation_analysis": true
  }
}
```

### Manual Integration
```python
from bot.mcp.omnisearch_client import OmniSearchClient
from bot.strategy.llm_agent import LLMAgent

# Create OmniSearch client
omnisearch = OmniSearchClient(
    server_url="http://localhost:8766",
    api_key="your_api_key"
)

# Create enhanced LLM agent
llm_agent = LLMAgent(
    model_provider="openai",
    model_name="gpt-4",
    omnisearch_client=omnisearch
)

# Agent will now use OmniSearch for enhanced analysis
trade_action = await llm_agent.analyze_market(market_state)
```

## Files Modified

1. `/bot/strategy/llm_agent.py` - Core LLM agent with OmniSearch integration
2. `/bot/main.py` - Trading engine with client initialization and management
3. `/bot/strategy/memory_enhanced_agent.py` - Memory agent with OmniSearch support
4. `/test_omnisearch_integration.py` - Comprehensive test script (new)
5. `/OMNISEARCH_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation (new)

## Configuration Reference

The integration uses existing configuration in `bot/config.py` under `OmniSearchSettings`. All features are disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled.

The implementation maintains complete backward compatibility - if OmniSearch is disabled or unavailable, the system operates exactly as before with no degradation in functionality.
