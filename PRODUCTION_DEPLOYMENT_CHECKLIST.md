## 📋 Pre-Production Checklist

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] **API Keys Configuration**
  - [ ] Set `LLM__OPENAI_API_KEY` in production environment
  - [ ] Verify CDP API credentials are properly configured
  - [ ] Test all API connections in production environment
  
- [ ] **Environment Variables**
  ```bash
  # Required production environment variables
  LLM__OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-key>
  DRY_RUN=true  # Set to false only after full validation
  SYMBOL=BTC-USD
  ENVIRONMENT=production
  LOG_LEVEL=INFO
  ```

### 2. Security & Access Control
- [ ] **API Security**
  - [ ] Rotate all API keys before production deployment
  - [ ] Implement IP whitelisting for exchange APIs
  - [ ] Set up secure secret management (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
  - [ ] Enable 2FA on all exchange accounts

- [ ] **Container Security**
  - [ ] Run containers as non-root user
  - [ ] Implement resource limits and security contexts
  - [ ] Regular security scanning of container images
  - [ ] Network policy restrictions

### 3. Configuration Management
- [ ] **Trading Configuration**
  - [ ] Review and validate `config/production.json`
  - [ ] Set conservative risk parameters initially:
    - `max_size_pct: 5.0` (start small)
    - `max_daily_loss_pct: 1.0`
    - `leverage: 2` (conservative leverage)
  - [ ] Enable emergency stop-loss mechanisms

- [ ] **Monitoring Configuration**
  - [ ] Set up alert webhooks for critical events
  - [ ] Configure health check intervals
  - [ ] Enable performance monitoring

### 4. Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] **Container Orchestration**
  ```bash
  # Production deployment commands
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
  docker-compose logs -f ai-trading-bot
  ```

- [ ] **Resource Allocation**
  - [ ] CPU: Minimum 2 cores
  - [ ] Memory: Minimum 4GB RAM
  - [ ] Storage: 20GB for logs and data
  - [ ] Network: Stable, low-latency connection

- [ ] **Data Persistence**
  - [ ] Set up persistent volumes for:
    - Trading logs (`/app/logs`)
    - Position data (`/app/data/positions`)
    - Performance metrics (`/app/data/paper_trading`)

### 5. Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] **System Monitoring**
  - [ ] Container health checks
  - [ ] Resource utilization monitoring
  - [ ] API rate limit monitoring
  - [ ] Network connectivity monitoring

- [ ] **Trading Monitoring**
  - [ ] Position size monitoring
  - [ ] P&L tracking and alerts
  - [ ] Risk metric monitoring
  - [ ] Trading frequency analysis

- [ ] **Alert Configuration**
  - [ ] High loss alerts (>1% daily loss)
  - [ ] API connection failures
  - [ ] System resource exhaustion
  - [ ] Trading halt conditions

### 6. Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Pre-Production Testing**
  - [ ] Run integration tests: `poetry run python comprehensive_integration_test.py`
  - [ ] Validate market data ingestion over 24 hours
  - [ ] Test emergency stop mechanisms
  - [ ] Validate all alert channels

- [ ] **Paper Trading Validation**
  - [ ] Run paper trading for minimum 7 days
  - [ ] Analyze trading decisions and performance
  - [ ] Validate risk management effectiveness
  - [ ] Review all generated logs

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Dry-Run Production Deployment
1. **Deploy with DRY_RUN=true**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables
   export DRY_RUN=true
   export ENVIRONMENT=production
   
   # Deploy container
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

2. **Monitor for 48 hours**
   - Verify market data ingestion
   - Monitor trading decisions
   - Validate risk management
   - Check all logs and metrics

3. **Performance Validation**
   ```bash
   # Check paper trading performance
   poetry run ai-trading-bot performance --days 7
   
   # Export trade history
   poetry run ai-trading-bot export-trades --days 7 --format json
   ```

### Phase 2: Live Trading (After Validation)
1. **Final Configuration Review**
   - Review all trading parameters
   - Confirm risk limits
   - Validate emergency procedures

2. **Go Live with Minimal Position**
   ```bash
   # Only after successful dry-run phase
   export DRY_RUN=false
   export TRADING__MAX_SIZE_PCT=2.0  # Start very small
   
   # Restart with live trading
   docker-compose restart ai-trading-bot
   ```

3. **Gradual Scale-Up**
   - Start with 2% position sizes
   - Monitor for 1 week
   - Gradually increase to target sizes
   - Maintain strict monitoring

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Market Data Issues
```bash
# Check market data connection
docker-compose exec ai-trading-bot poetry run python -c "
from bot.data.market import MarketDataProvider
import asyncio
async def test():
    md = MarketDataProvider('BTC-USD', '1m')
    await md.connect()
    data = md.get_latest_ohlcv(10)
    print(f'Retrieved {len(data)} candles')
    await md.disconnect()
asyncio.run(test())
"
```

#### CDP Authentication Issues
```bash
# Test CDP connection
docker-compose exec ai-trading-bot poetry run python -c "
from bot.exchange.coinbase import CoinbaseClient
import asyncio
async def test():
    client = CoinbaseClient()
    connected = await client.connect()
    print(f'Connected: {connected}')
    if connected:
        status = client.get_connection_status()
        print(f'Status: {status}')
        await client.disconnect()
asyncio.run(test())
"
```

#### Performance Issues
```bash
# Monitor resource usage
docker stats ai-trading-bot

# Check logs for errors
docker-compose logs --tail 100 ai-trading-bot

# Restart if needed
docker-compose restart ai-trading-bot
