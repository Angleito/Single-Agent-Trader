### Spot Trading Configuration
To use spot trading mode:
```bash
# In your .env file
TRADING__ENABLE_FUTURES=false  # Enable spot trading mode
TRADING__SYMBOL=ETH-USD       # Spot trading pair
```

Use the optimized spot trading config:
```bash
# Copy spot trading configuration
cp config/spot_trading_config.json config/development.json
```

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Setup Your Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-trading-bot

# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Add Your API Keys

Edit `.env` with your credentials:

```bash
# Required: Coinbase API credentials
COINBASE_API_KEY=your_coinbase_api_key_here
COINBASE_API_SECRET=your_coinbase_api_secret_here
COINBASE_PASSPHRASE=your_coinbase_passphrase_here

# Required: OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Get your API keys:**
- **Coinbase**: [Advanced Trade API](https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/api-keys)
- **OpenAI**: [Platform API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### 3. Start Trading

```bash
# Start the bot (in safe paper trading mode)
docker-compose up

# For development (with live code reloading)
docker-compose --profile dev up
```

**That's it!** The bot starts in paper trading mode (`SYSTEM__DRY_RUN=true`) for safety. This single environment variable controls all paper trading features - no need for CLI flags or separate settings.

## Trading Modes

### Paper Trading (Recommended First)
```bash
# Safe paper trading - no real money
# This is the default mode when SYSTEM__DRY_RUN=true
docker-compose up
```

### Live Trading (When Ready)
```bash
# 1. Edit .env and set SYSTEM__DRY_RUN=false
# 2. Start with small positions
# 3. WARNING: This uses real money!
docker-compose up
```

### Development Mode
```bash
# Live code reloading for development
docker-compose --profile dev up
```

## Configuration

All configuration is done via the `.env` file:

```bash
# Trading Mode Control (Single Toggle)
SYSTEM__DRY_RUN=true       # true = Paper trading (safe, simulated trades)
                           # false = Live trading (real money!)

# Trading settings
TRADING__SYMBOL=BTC-USD    # Trading pair
MAX_POSITION_SIZE=0.1      # 10% of portfolio max
RISK_PER_TRADE=0.02        # 2% risk per trade

# Safety settings
MAX_DAILY_LOSS=0.05        # Stop if 5% daily loss
STOP_LOSS_ENABLED=true     # Enable stop losses
TAKE_PROFIT_ENABLED=true   # Enable take profits
```

**Note:** The `SYSTEM__DRY_RUN` variable is the single master toggle for paper trading. When set to `true`, all trading operations are simulated. There are no additional CLI flags or settings needed - this one variable controls everything.

## Memory & Learning System (MCP)

The bot includes an advanced memory system that learns from every trade to improve future decisions.

### How It Works

**Automatic Memory Collection:**
- Records every trading decision with full market context
- Tracks trade outcomes (profit/loss, duration)
- Monitors market conditions throughout trades
- Generates insights from completed trades

**Memory-Enhanced Decisions:**
- Automatically retrieves similar past trades before each decision
- Shows the LLM what worked (or didn't) in similar conditions
- Identifies winning and losing patterns over time
- Adapts strategies based on accumulated experience

### Setup Options

#### Option 1: Local Memory (Default - No API Key Required)
```bash
# In your .env file:
MCP_ENABLED=true
MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8765

# Start with memory enabled:
docker-compose up -d mcp-memory
docker-compose up ai-trading-bot
```

All memories stored locally in `./data/mcp_memory/`

#### Option 2: With Cloud Backup (Optional)
```bash
# Sign up at https://mem0.ai for an API key
# In your .env file:
MCP_ENABLED=true
MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8765
MEM0_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### What Gets Tracked

Every trade captures:
- Market conditions at entry (price, indicators, dominance)
- Trading decision and reasoning
- Position changes throughout the trade
- Final outcome and performance metrics
- Learned insights for future trades

### Memory in Action

The LLM sees past experiences in its prompts:
```
PAST TRADING EXPERIENCES:
1. 2024-01-15: LONG at $45,230 (RSI=62, Cipher B=15)
   Outcome: Profit +$523 (+1.2% in 45min)
   Insight: Quick profit when RSI > 60 with positive cipher

2. 2024-01-10: SHORT at $45,500 (RSI=68, Cipher B=-5)
   Outcome: Loss -$312 (-0.7% in 120min)
   Insight: Shorting in uptrend was premature
```

## Monitoring

### View Logs
```bash
# Follow bot logs
docker-compose logs -f ai-trading-bot

# View specific logs
docker-compose logs ai-trading-bot

# View memory server logs
docker-compose logs -f mcp-memory
```

### Health Check
```bash
# Check if bot is running
docker-compose ps

# Check container health
docker inspect ai-trading-bot --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}'

# Check memory server health
curl http://localhost:8765/health
```

## Data Persistence

Your data is automatically saved in:
- `./logs/` - Trading logs and events
- `./data/` - Market data and trading history
- `./data/mcp_memory/` - Trading experiences and learned patterns
- `./config/` - Configuration files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot won't start?**
```bash
# Check your .env file has valid API keys
cat .env

# Check container logs
docker-compose logs ai-trading-bot
```

**No trading activity?**
```bash
# Ensure SYSTEM__DRY_RUN=true for paper trading
# Check market hours (crypto trades 24/7)
# Verify API keys are correct
```

**Docker issues on macOS?**
```bash
# Make sure OrbStack or Docker Desktop is running
docker ps

# Restart Docker if needed
docker-compose down && docker-compose up
```
