- Paper trades being "executed"
- Real-time performance tracking

### 3. Moving to Live Trading

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Only move to live trading after:
- Testing thoroughly in dry-run mode
- Understanding the risks involved
- Having proper API keys configured
- Setting conservative risk parameters

```bash
# When ready for live trading (REAL MONEY AT RISK!)
python -m bot.main live
```

## Configuration and Setup

### 1. Environment Variables Reference

The bot uses environment variables for configuration. Here's what each setting controls:

#### **System Settings**
```env
# Basic system configuration
SYSTEM__ENVIRONMENT=development     # development, staging, production
SYSTEM__DRY_RUN=true               # true = paper trading, false = real money

- ✅ System can connect to exchanges and LLM providers

## Trading Strategies and Risk Management

### 1. How the AI Makes Trading Decisions

The bot uses a sophisticated multi-layer approach:

#### **Step 1: Market Data Analysis**
- Fetches real-time price data from Coinbase
- Calculates technical indicators (VuManChu Cipher A & B)
- Analyzes market trends and momentum

#### **Step 2: AI Decision Making**
The LLM (Large Language Model) analyzes:
- Current market conditions
- Technical indicator signals
- Risk/reward ratios
- Market sentiment and trends

#### **Step 3: Risk Management Validation**
Before any trade:
- Validates position size limits
- Checks daily loss limits
- Ensures stop-loss and take-profit levels
- Verifies account balance requirements

#### **Step 4: Trade Execution**
If all checks pass:
- Places the order on Coinbase
- Sets up stop-loss and take-profit orders
- Monitors position performance

### 2. Understanding Risk Management

#### **Position Sizing**
The bot automatically calculates position sizes based on:
- Your account balance
- Configured maximum position size percentage
- Current leverage setting
- Risk assessment of the trade

```
Position Size = (Account Balance × Max Size %) × Leverage / Current Price
```

Example with $10,000 account:
- Max size: 20%
- Leverage: 5x
- BTC price: $50,000

Position Size = ($10,000 × 20%) × 5 / $50,000 = 0.2 BTC

#### **Stop Loss and Take Profit**
Every trade includes automatic risk management:

**Stop Loss**: Automatically closes losing positions
- Limits maximum loss per trade
- Default: 2% of position value
- Configurable per trade and globally

**Take Profit**: Automatically closes winning positions
- Locks in profits when targets are reached
- Default: 4% of position value
- Maintains favorable risk/reward ratio

#### **Daily Loss Limits**
The bot stops trading if daily losses exceed your limit:
- Prevents catastrophic losses
- Allows emotional cooling-off period
- Resets at market open each day

### 3. Customizing Trading Strategy

#### **Timeframe Selection**
Choose your trading timeframe based on your style:

```env
# Scalping (fast trades)
TRADING__INTERVAL=1m

# Day trading
TRADING__INTERVAL=5m
TRADING__INTERVAL=15m

# Swing trading
TRADING__INTERVAL=1h
TRADING__INTERVAL=4h
```

#### **Leverage Settings**
Adjust leverage based on your risk tolerance:

```env
# Conservative (recommended for beginners)
TRADING__LEVERAGE=2

# Moderate
TRADING__LEVERAGE=5

# Aggressive (experienced traders only)
TRADING__LEVERAGE=10
```

⚠️ **Leverage Warning**: Higher leverage amplifies both gains AND losses!

#### **Symbol Selection**
Currently supported trading pairs:

```env
# Major cryptocurrencies
TRADING__SYMBOL=BTC-USD    # Bitcoin
TRADING__SYMBOL=ETH-USD    # Ethereum
TRADING__SYMBOL=SOL-USD    # Solana
TRADING__SYMBOL=ADA-USD    # Cardano
```

### 4. Risk Management Best Practices

#### **Start Small**
- Begin with minimum position sizes
- Use conservative leverage (2-3x maximum)
- Set tight daily loss limits (1-3%)

#### **Diversification**
- Don't put all funds in one trade
- Consider multiple trading pairs
- Vary position sizes based on confidence

#### **Emotional Control**
- Let the bot make decisions
- Don't manually override during drawdowns
- Review performance weekly, not hourly

#### **Regular Monitoring**
- Check bot status daily
- Review trading performance weekly
- Adjust parameters based on results
