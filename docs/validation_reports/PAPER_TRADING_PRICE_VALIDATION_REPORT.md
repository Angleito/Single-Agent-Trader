## Validation Focus Areas

### 1. Price Conversion Accuracy ✅
- SUI-PERP prices convert from 18-decimal format to realistic $3-4 range
- Price validation prevents out-of-range values
- Mixed format data handled correctly

### 2. Paper Trading Balance Behavior ✅  
- Starting balances remain at configured amounts ($10,000)
- Account growth is proportional to market movements
- No unrealistic balance inflation to millions
- Profit/loss calculations are mathematically sound

### 3. Regression Prevention ✅
- Previous problematic prices (24.45, 0.38) are handled correctly
- Mixed ticker data conversion works properly
- Edge cases are handled gracefully

## Specific Validation Criteria
