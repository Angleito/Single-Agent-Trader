## Specific Issue Resolution

### The $26.9M Inflation Problem - RESOLVED

**Original Issue:**
```
üö® BEFORE FIX:
Starting Balance: $10,000
SUI Price Display: $24.45 / $0.38 (corrupted)
Result: Account inflated to $26,891,689.26
Status: ‚ùå BROKEN
```

**Current State:**
```
‚úÖ AFTER FIX:
Starting Balance: $10,000
