# Docker Service Status Report

Generated: 2025-06-23

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: None of the AI Trading Bot services are running. The bluefin-service and dashboard-backend DNS failures are occurring because:
1. The Docker network `trading-network` does not exist
2. None of the services defined in docker-compose.yml are running
3. Only unrelated services (robustty-bot, robustty-redis) are currently active

## Current Docker Status

### Running Containers
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               COMMAND            STATUS       NAMES
574d595fdd55   robustty-robustty   "/app/start.sh"    Up 6 hours   robustty-bot
6ee18420522f   redis:7-alpine      "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   Up 6 hours   robustty-redis
```

### Docker Images (Built and Ready) ‚úÖ

```

### Docker Networks
- bridge (default)
- host (default)
- none (default)
- **MISSING**: trading-network ‚ùå

### Expected Services (NOT RUNNING)
1. **bluefin-service** - Bluefin DEX operations service
2. **ai-trading-bot** - Main trading bot
3. **mcp-omnisearch** - Market intelligence service
4. **mcp-memory** - AI learning/memory service
5. **dashboard-backend** - Dashboard API service
6. **dashboard-frontend** - Dashboard UI service
7. **dashboard-nginx** - Nginx reverse proxy (production profile)

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Network Not Created
The `trading-network` bridge network required by all services does not exist. This network is defined in docker-compose.yml but was never created.

### 2. Services Never Started
Docker-compose services were never started. The `docker-compose ps` command returns empty results, indicating no services from the compose file are running.

### 3. DNS Resolution Failures
- `bluefin-service` cannot be resolved because:
  - The container is not running
  - The network it should be on doesn't exist
- `dashboard-backend` cannot be resolved for the same reasons

### 4. WebSocket Connection Failures
Recent error logs show the trading bot attempting to connect to dashboard-backend WebSocket endpoint:
```
OSError: Multiple exceptions: [Errno 61] Connect call failed ('::1', 8000, 0, 0), 
[Errno 61] Connect call failed ('127.0.0.1', 8000)
```
This confirms the dashboard-backend service is not accessible.

## Service Dependencies

The services have the following dependency chain:
```
trading-network (network)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bluefin-service
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp-omnisearch
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp-memory
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard-backend (depends on bluefin-service)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard-frontend (depends on dashboard-backend)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-trading-bot (depends on mcp-omnisearch, mcp-memory)
```

## Recommended Fixes

### Step 1: Stop Unrelated Services (Optional)
If the robustty services are not needed:
```bash
docker stop robustty-bot robustty-redis
docker rm robustty-bot robustty-redis
```

### Step 2: Set Up Permissions (Critical)
Run the permissions setup script first:
```bash
cd /Users/angel/Documents/Projects/cursorprod
./setup-docker-permissions.sh
```

### Step 3: Start All Services
Start services in the correct order:
```bash
# Start all services (includes network creation)
docker-compose up -d

# Or start specific services in order:
docker-compose up -d bluefin-service mcp-omnisearch mcp-memory
docker-compose up -d dashboard-backend
docker-compose up -d dashboard-frontend
docker-compose up -d ai-trading-bot
```

### Step 4: Verify Services
```bash
# Check all services are running
docker-compose ps

# Verify network connectivity
docker network inspect trading-network

# Test service health
curl http://localhost:8081/health  # bluefin-service
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # dashboard-backend
curl http://localhost:8765/health  # mcp-memory
```

## Service Configuration Details

### Network Configuration
All services connect to `trading-network` with specific aliases:

- **bluefin-service**: Accessible as `bluefin-service`, `bluefin`
- **dashboard-backend**: Accessible as `dashboard-backend`, `api`
- **mcp-memory**: Accessible as `mcp-memory`, `memory-server`
- **mcp-omnisearch**: Accessible as `mcp-omnisearch`, `omnisearch`

### Port Mappings (localhost only)
- `8081` ‚Üí bluefin-service (8080 internal)
- `8000` ‚Üí dashboard-backend
- `3000` ‚Üí dashboard-frontend
- `8765` ‚Üí mcp-memory
- `8767` ‚Üí mcp-omnisearch

## Troubleshooting Commands

### Check Docker daemon status
```bash
docker version
systemctl status docker  # Linux
```

### View service logs
```bash
docker-compose logs -f bluefin-service
docker-compose logs -f dashboard-backend
docker-compose logs -f ai-trading-bot
```

### Restart specific service
```bash
docker-compose restart bluefin-service
docker-compose restart dashboard-backend
```

### Complete reset
```bash
docker-compose down -v  # Remove containers and volumes
docker-compose up -d   # Recreate everything
```

## Environment Validation

Ensure `.env` file contains required variables:
- `HOST_UID` and `HOST_GID` (set by setup-docker-permissions.sh)
- `EXCHANGE__BLUEFIN_PRIVATE_KEY` (if using Bluefin)
- `BLUEFIN_SERVICE_API_KEY` (for service authentication)
- Other API keys as needed

## Security Notes

1. All services bind to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only) for security
2. Services run with limited capabilities and read-only root filesystems
3. User permissions are mapped to host user via `HOST_UID/HOST_GID`

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/angel/Documents/Projects/cursorprod

# 1. Setup permissions (REQUIRED first time)
./setup-docker-permissions.sh

# 2. Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Monitor startup (watch for errors)
docker-compose logs -f

# 4. Verify all services are running
docker-compose ps
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Permission Denied Errors
**Solution**: Run `./setup-docker-permissions.sh` and ensure HOST_UID/HOST_GID are set in .env

### Issue: Service Fails to Start
**Solution**: Check logs with `docker-compose logs <service-name>` and verify required environment variables

### Issue: Network Connectivity Between Services
**Solution**: Ensure all services are on the same network with `docker network inspect trading-network`

### Issue: Port Already in Use
**Solution**: Check for conflicts with `lsof -i :8000` (or other ports) and stop conflicting services

## Next Steps

1. Run `./setup-docker-permissions.sh` to ensure proper permissions
2. Execute `docker-compose up -d` to start all services
3. Monitor logs with `docker-compose logs -f`
4. Verify connectivity with health check endpoints
5. Check dashboard at http://localhost:3000 once services are running

## Additional Notes

- Docker images are already built and ready to run
- The `docker-compose.override.yml` provides additional safety configurations
- All services are configured with health checks for reliability
- Services use the principle of least privilege for security
- Docker Compose version: v2.36.2 (compatible ‚úÖ)

## Verification Script

Save this as `verify-services.sh` and run after starting services:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "üîç Verifying AI Trading Bot Services..."
echo "======================================="

# Check network
echo -n "Trading Network: "
docker network ls | grep -q trading-network && echo "‚úÖ Created" || echo "‚ùå Missing"

# Check services
services=("bluefin-service" "ai-trading-bot" "mcp-memory" "mcp-omnisearch" "dashboard-backend" "dashboard-frontend")
for service in "${services[@]}"; do
    echo -n "$service: "
    if docker ps | grep -q $service; then
        echo "‚úÖ Running"
    else
        echo "‚ùå Not running"
    fi
done

# Check health endpoints

echo "Health Checks:"
curl -s http://localhost:8081/health >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "‚úÖ Bluefin Service" || echo "‚ùå Bluefin Service"

curl -s http://localhost:8765/health >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "‚úÖ MCP Memory" || echo "‚ùå MCP Memory"
