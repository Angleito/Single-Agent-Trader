### ⚠️ Services with Issues

4. **ai-trading-bot**
   - Status: Running (health: starting)
   - Issue: Health check timing out after 20s
   - Root Cause: Cannot connect to dashboard-backend WebSocket
   - Error logs:
     ```
     WARNING - bot.websocket_publisher - ✗ Network connectivity to http://dashboard-backend:8000/health failed
     ERROR - bot.websocket_publisher - Failed to connect to dashboard WebSocket
     ```
   - Note: Service is configured for Coinbase exchange (not Bluefin)

### ❌ Failed Services

5. **bluefin-service**
   - Status: Restarting continuously
   - Exit Code: 1
   - Root Cause: Missing environment variable
   - Error: `BluefinConnectionError: BLUEFIN_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable not set`
   - Note: This service may not be required as `EXCHANGE__EXCHANGE_TYPE=coinbase` in .env

6. **dashboard-frontend**
   - Status: Restarting continuously
   - Exit Code: 1
   - Root Cause: Read-only file system
   - Error: `/docker-entrypoint.d/inject-env.sh: line 39: can't create /usr/share/nginx/html/runtime-env.js: Read-only file system`

## Network Configuration

**Network Name:** trading-network  
**Subnet:** 172.20.0.0/16  
**Gateway:** 172.20.0.1

### Service IP Assignments:
- mcp-omnisearch-server: 172.20.0.3
- mcp-memory-server: 172.20.0.4
- dashboard-backend: 172.20.0.5
- ai-trading-bot: 172.20.0.2
- bluefin-service: (not stable due to restarts)

## Identified Issues

### 1. Network Connectivity Problem
- **Issue:** ai-trading-bot cannot reach dashboard-backend despite being on the same network
- **Root Cause Identified:** dashboard-backend is binding to 127.0.0.1:8000 instead of 0.0.0.0:8000
- **Test Results:**
  - ✅ DNS resolution works: `dashboard-backend` resolves to 172.20.0.5
  - ❌ Connection fails because service only listens on localhost
  - ✅ dashboard-backend health endpoint works internally (from within its container)
  - 🔍 `netstat` shows: `LISTEN 127.0.0.1:8000` (should be `0.0.0.0:8000`)
- **Impact:** Trading bot cannot publish real-time updates to dashboard

### 2. Missing Configuration
- **bluefin-service:** Requires `BLUEFIN_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable
- **Current Config:** System is configured for Coinbase (`EXCHANGE__EXCHANGE_TYPE=coinbase`)
- **Recommendation:** Either provide the key or disable bluefin-service if not needed

### 3. File System Permissions
- **dashboard-frontend:** Cannot write runtime configuration due to read-only file system
- **Impact:** Frontend cannot inject runtime environment variables

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **For dashboard-backend network binding (CRITICAL):**
   - Update dashboard-backend to bind to `0.0.0.0:8000` instead of `127.0.0.1:8000`
   - Check the Python app's host configuration (likely in `main.py` or environment variables)
   - Example fix: `app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)` instead of `host="127.0.0.1"`

2. **For bluefin-service:** Either:
   - Add `BLUEFIN_PRIVATE_KEY` to .env file, OR
   - Comment out bluefin-service in docker-compose.yml if using Coinbase only

3. **For dashboard-frontend:** 
   - Check Docker volume mounts and ensure write permissions
   - Verify Dockerfile doesn't set read-only file system
   - Consider mounting runtime-env.js as a volume

4. **For ai-trading-bot connectivity:**
   - Will be resolved once dashboard-backend binds to all interfaces
   - Consider using docker-compose service dependencies for startup order

### Configuration Review:
```yaml
# Suggested docker-compose service dependencies
ai-trading-bot:
  depends_on:
    dashboard-backend:
      condition: service_healthy
    mcp-memory:
      condition: service_healthy
    mcp-omnisearch:
      condition: service_healthy
```

## Commands for Troubleshooting

```bash
# Fix dashboard-backend network binding (IMMEDIATE FIX)
docker-compose down dashboard-backend
echo "DASHBOARD_HOST=0.0.0.0" >> .env
docker-compose up -d dashboard-backend

# Or add to docker-compose.yml under dashboard-backend environment:
# - DASHBOARD_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Stop problematic services if not needed
docker-compose stop bluefin-service

# Rebuild dashboard-frontend with proper permissions
docker-compose build --no-cache dashboard-frontend

# Restart all services with proper configuration
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f ai-trading-bot dashboard-backend

# Verify connectivity fix
docker exec ai-trading-bot curl -s http://dashboard-backend:8000/health
```

## Root Cause Summary

1. **dashboard-backend** - Binding to localhost only (127.0.0.1) instead of all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
   - **Fix:** Set `DASHBOARD_HOST=0.0.0.0` environment variable

2. **bluefin-service** - Missing required private key
   - **Fix:** Provide `BLUEFIN_PRIVATE_KEY` or disable service if using Coinbase

3. **dashboard-frontend** - Read-only file system preventing runtime configuration
   - **Fix:** Adjust volume mounts or Dockerfile to allow writing to `/usr/share/nginx/html/`

4. **ai-trading-bot** - Cannot connect to dashboard due to issue #1 above
   - **Fix:** Will resolve automatically once dashboard-backend binds to 0.0.0.0

## Conclusion

While core services (memory server, omnisearch, and dashboard backend API) are running, critical configuration issues prevent the full system from functioning. The primary blocker is the dashboard-backend's network binding configuration, which can be quickly fixed by setting `DASHBOARD_HOST=0.0.0.0`. Once resolved, the AI trading bot should be able to connect and publish real-time updates to the dashboard.
